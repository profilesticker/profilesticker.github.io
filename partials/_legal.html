                            No, we don't. When you upload your profile picture from Facebook or from your computer it is only processed temporarily until you've 
                            selected your sticker and processed the image from your end. Every time you refresh the page, you'll notice that the picture no longer exists.

                            Profile Sticker does not accept your personal data like your name, email address, passwords or any other sensitive information. Since you can 
                            think of this as an image editing app, we only require you to upload your profile picture from your computer or from Facebook, either way, we do not store your image (as mentioned above).

                            <b>Facebook: </b>If you decide to upload a picture from Facebook and/or post the processed image to Facebook, you (as a Facebook user) would need to authorise Profile Sticker (as a Facebook app) to be able to grab your profile picture. The permission 
                            requested are the most basic ones available and provided by Facebook for an app to use a users profile picture or post a picture on your timeline.
